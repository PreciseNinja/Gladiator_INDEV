To Play the game, download the Game_Folder.
However, the game won't run immediately, you're going to have to do some setup.
First, download python 3.10.0 from the python website, and set it as PATH.
Then, open your shell window(Windows PowerShell for windows users) and type in "pip install pygame"
Finally, navigate to the "Source" folder in your Game_Folder
Click "main.py" and voila!  Keep in mind this is an INDEV VERSION and bugs are likely to happen.  New features will be added
(At the time of writing this, all you can do is move around).
